,,Digital resources could be updated,,,,,,,"I would like to see the jr. high be given more freedom to decide how best their class could ""live their faith."" For example, let their class decide where to donate money instead of St. Jude's and American Heart Association, have them choose Catholic Charities and local Charities instead so that they can see the effect they have directly. Plus, by making the choices themselves you may see more ownership as well as the children seeing what it means to ""live their Catholic Faith.""","I think the idea of restitutions are ineffective. Unless different chores are associated with the extra time at school. The children think they're a joke and it doesn't seem to dissuade bad behavior. I think if children make a mess in the bathroom, they should spend extra time after school cleaning up bathrooms. I'm sure the janitorial staff would also appreciate an apology note handed to them in person as the child helps clean after school.
If they are disruptive in the halls during school maybe they should do research as to why this would be a distraction to others (ie. paper on what it takes to stay focused). I believe the punishment should better reflect the crime if we are to change behavior. ","I believe St. Joe does a good job of offering fun activities. What also might be fun to encourage others to try something new and at the same time encourage support of ones classmates is to offer a shared extra curricular calendar that would reflect not only ICCL sports going on that weekend but that parents could add an activity that their child is competing in (say swimming, gymnastics, hockey, fencing, etc.) that others may not know about and would like to cheer on their fellow Eagle.  ","St. Joe offers many ways to be involved however, we don't always have enough volunteers for regularly scheduled activities and needs. I would recommend going to a required 20 hours donated per family. 1) 10 hours to the school in various ways - volunteering in classrooms, recess duty, hot lunch, coaching sports. 2) 10 hours solely to fundraising activities - auction, trivia night, burger king books, SCRIP, etc.
For those that can't volunteer hours: Have a sliding scale, based upon volunteered income bracket and charge what $20hrs. of their time would be...ex. $200-400
I think this will create a more balanced volunteering so the burden is not on just a few families (that eventually burn out and never volunteer again) and it will give other families to try something different, feel more a part of the St. Joe community and show their kids what it means to give back to a school that does so much for them.",,,,,,,,"The feeling of family at the school, The academics, The teachers",I think a few of the teachers could be replaced. Some don't seem to correct behavior that has been going on for years (always late to everything...including lunch that the kids only have have 10 min to eat as it is). A few don't seem to have patience for kids that struggle and only cater to the over achievers. I would like to see lesson plans in Jr. High especially be updated and better communicated with the students. ,"I think the Spanish program could be moved to an online course and have the teacher just moderate. This would allow the students to move at their own pace and they would be better prepared. They could even pick a different language other than Spanish. I think this could have a HUGE impact in the long run when the kids enter High School, especially if they start with something like Rosetta Stone in Kindergarten.
I would like to see the Jr. High be given more responsibility and more opportunities to serve and be leaders. For example: Allow them to do morning and afternoon announcements, have the 8th graders create a one page News sheet that can be emailed or printed (solely for the students by the students..Eagle News or student gazette), let the 8th grade create a playlist (that is ok'd by faculty) to be played during lunch or outside during recess, they can create ""crazy sock"" days that are like dress down days but they go to a local charity (St. Margaret's house, Women's Care Center, La Casa, etc.). What about a monthly decorate your homeroom door - this would cater to the kiddos that aren't as ""sports oriented"" and can show their creativity for all to see.

The 7th and 8th grade need to be given the opportunity for dances. It seems childish but in the ""screen driven"" world they live in they don't have the social skills.
Instead of one gym class a month invite different people that can teach them manners, one or two formal dances...bring in Catholic Motivational speakers...anything to create a dynamic and different opportunity to look forward to and not just the same old stuff every week...every month. School can be fun if we think outside the box and start reinventing what it means to be cool. We need to build camaraderie not just in jr. high but throughout the school in every classroom."

"Would love to see more classical curriculum: especially in literature, music, and art",,"A lot of the library books have content that just feels goofy.

","Hot lunch isn't a big deal to my family. We're fine bringing our brown bags every day. 

Is there a way to be a bit more attentive to kids with allergies? For example, when hot lunch menus are sent home can allergens be included if possible? And maybe for bake sales have a parent of a kids with allergies make some ""allergy approved"" items. 

What is the schedule to turn the old music room back into a stage in Fanelli. Would be nice to be able to have a stage for class music programs and nativity scenes and even the school talent show.

They therefore are often at higher levels of proficiency compared to those in their class.  I'm not sure that St. Joe has a clear way to provide more challenging work to those students that can handle it.  Parents I have spoken with that have older children have confirmed with me this same opinion.

,"Two of our children are more naturally disposed to academics. One is not. The one who is not has not necessarily always received the support he needs. It has varied by teach and grade. For instance this year, one of his teachers is helpful and tries to work with him.

This has been a bit more challenging.",,,I would put this between a 3 and 4 as my children get older and older.,,,This is hit or miss.

In regards to character development, I would give SJGS a 4 or 5. In regards to the way this is related to our faith I am much more skeptical. Specifically in the way that students behave at school mass. IT IS DISGRACEFUL. And please understand I am not an ultra-orthodox, liturgical nazi. What I mean is that it is NOT character development to have students simply able to sit still and be silent. To the contrary their utter lack of respect for the space as evidenced by the absence of genuflecting or appropriately reverencing the altar as they enter and exit a pew is ridiculous. Further, the SILENCE in that church during SONGS is embarrassing. But it is not embarrassing about the students, it is an embarrassment to the faculty, staff and even pastoral staff because clearly none of the adults who are charged with ""forming"" our students have made a point of calling the students on their silence. It takes SO little and they would step into line. If we at SJGS name mass as SO essential to our identity that we have it every week, it is equally essential that it is a reflection of what is best in our identity. Raising silent, non-participatory, non-invested sheep is not what we are called to as Catholic educators nor as Catholic parents.  This is my biggest disappointment in our school.

Continuing to find ways to differentiate to challenge all students at their level is of critical importance. Enhanced use of instructional technology (i.e. blended learning software programs) can be of some assistance here.,"While overall, I think SJGS is doing very well in this area, one area that can be improved is equipping parents with the knowledge of how to support their children's learning. While there is a wealth of data that comes home to parents regarding MAP testing (which is a great tool) and through other means, more can be done to equip parents about how they can be partners in advancing the learning goals and opportunities of their children. What is one thing you can do at home with your child in reading and math, etc.? MAP and programs like Khan Academy have some resources that could be helpful with this.

I have enough faith that the 5th grade boys aren't going to hurt the 3rd graders playing two hand touch, heck some of the 3rd graders are as big as some of the 5th graders. I think they should have less rules but with more severe consequences. There is a lot about life that can be learned in free playtime that can not be taught in the classroom. This is a safe environment where these things should be learned even if the result may occasionally be a scrape or hurt feelings.

Our experience overall with St. Joe, however, has been that our children are often not sufficiently challenged.

In the past, it seemed like the kids all knew what to do to stay out of trouble, but these were external controls--hoops for them to jump through. When I saw them on the playground or on the court during athletics--when true character shines through--I was surprised to find a sense of entitlement and exclusion. A big indicator for me is their Mass participation. I'd love to go to Mass with my kids on Wednesdays, but it sucks the life out of me. I'm the only one singing or saying a response. We have to explicitly teach our kids that we, as a family, participate at Sunday Mass differently than they do at school Mass--we make sure they are sharing their voices and participating fully. I invite you to sit in the back and just observe the students as they walk in. Count how many of them genuflect fully--you'll be able to count them on one hand. Most do a quick little hop and vaguely wave their hands around their face and chest.

If they were being taught true reverence, they'd approach the Eucharist differently.","I think the current discipline process (stop and reflect) is effective and well-executed by the teachers.

I'm a little disappointed in the communication and organization around the athletics program, however. It always seems like teams are being thrown together at the last minute. Also, in my opinion, the past administration did not do enough to involve boys in leadership positions. My hope is the new administration will improve on this front. We have an older child who graduated 8th grade several years ago and during the graduation activities, I did not see one single boy involved in a presentation or performance--not even as lector or carrying the gifts during the graduation Mass. It was shocking, and I raised it with the past principal--she said that they take the volunteers who step forward. Girls at this age are far more willing to take on public roles of leadership because they are more verbally advanced than boys--and the school culture is dominated by women, so they feel supported. It is no less important for boys to learn leadership, and it is my hope that the new administration will be more proactive in cultivating leadership in boys at the school.",,,"I always tell people that SJGS has excellent academic preparation, which is the most important factor for us.

We discovered later that summer that another child in the same grade in the same year as a new family WAS admitted b/c the parent exercised some special influence.

Third, I wish teachers were encouraged to think critically about the ""hidden curriculum"" and how it may unintentionally promote unhelpful gender, cultural, and/or racial biases. For example, some teachers refer to ""boys and girls"" and call them separately for particular tasks (e.g., ""all the boys line up""), and there are separate bins for boys' and girls' lunchboxes. These are unhelpful practices that signal to children that ""boys versus girls"" is an important classification to make and that the two groups of children should be treated differently. I have also heard from a friend with children in a higher grade that some teachers are still using outdated sentence stems for vocabulary words that promote gender stereotypes (e.g., ""the woman wearing an apron in the kitchen...""), and I know some other teachers are using activities and showing images that may unintentionally promote cultural and/or racial stereotypes. I know everyone at SJGS has good intentions and nobody would explicitly promote stereotypes, but implicit learning processes play a much greater role in the development of biases and stereotypes, so it's important to keep a critical eye toward some traditional practices.",Thanks for seeking our feedback!

Having had 4 children through, not one of them have found their time at La Casa to be beneficial for them, or the children there. St. Margarets is fabulous and the year the class adopted the veterans center are excellent. Again, I think providing hands on, active learning as well as lectures are important to inspire learning. When my child reports that they listened to a teacher read from the book for a class period, and this happens frequently, then I think more effort needs to be put in by the educator to provide stimulating, thought provoking, opportunities to learn the material.

Simply explain to kids and their parents that if they do not eat during lunch, they will be hungry later and that is no one else's responsibility to manage. If their classroom behavior or performance suffer, as a result, that is also their SOLE responsibility.

I also feel that the school is stuck in an old model of relying on parent volunteers for basic functions.  Now that so many families have two working parents this just isn't feasible.  It is fine for parents to help with centers and special events, but for everyday, essential functions like recess, you need a reliable presence who can get to know the kids and school procedures.  I would pay more to have these services covered (and would even pay extra to cover financial aid so that families who can't pay more can still attend)."

When the principal writes that basically we not to communicate with him and go through the teacher, it says that he is not willing to be part of community.

Coming from another catholic grade school in our dioceses- I can say that SJGS is highly more challenging. I see it appropriate for the higher grade levels but placement for my son in the kindergarten program coming from 4/5 pre k was very disappointing. I found it extremely difficult and wonder if this is only due to the fact that there is a 5/6 program option for the students that fall in between. At our old school our son would have been placed in a kindergarten class. We still belong to that parish and plan to continue to remain there.,,,Most. I wonder if my daughter's homeroom teacher is experienced enough to be teaching junior high literature. We definitely saw a decrease in the material her class covered compared to our other school. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Challenging curriculum, structure of how faith is taught, outstanding group of students attending SJGS",,

Many parents do not work near the school and the kids have to stand outside.  The school needs to get with times on this.,
,,For 3rd grade my child is doing the same thing as older sibling - one would think some of the curriculum change or be updated ,,,,If the trimester ends on November 13 - why do we have to wait almost 10 days for report cards/conference? I would think that all grades are kept up throughout the trimester as well the information within the report card are kept up so the teacher isn't entering all information at the last minute. ,,,,,,,,,,Grades k-5 I find the teachers communicate more however 6th grade not so much because in part my child more than 2+ teachers ,,,,,,
,,,"I think SJGS has teachers that are enthusiastic, but not all of it's teachers are effective and many seem ""stuck"" in their way of teaching. SJGS has a handful of teachers who show a desire to grow professionally and try new things in their classroom to custom fit their class year to year. ",We often don't know how our child is doing in Science (Jr High) since assignments don't seem to be graded and logged in to Power School.,,,,,I think there is a considerable problem with disrespect with the Jr High students. ,,,,,,,,,,,"I am pleased with the new life that SJGS has been given this year. There is a great sense of community and, although some grades still suffer, most of the teaching staff makes SJGS an academically challenging place. ","I think there needs to be a change to the Jr High. Having had two other children go through SJGS, I believe that there is too much freedom given to an age that instead needs to be reined in.
So much of the curriculum content is predictable. There are certain grades that use the same content year after year (my younger children could probably skate through their classes using their older siblings materials). I believe the standards could still be met and at the same time introduce new projects.
Teachers expect the students to produce their best work, and yet they send home worksheets that are junky and outdated.  ",

"I have found that much of the curriculum is old and out dated, inappropriate and irrelevant. Worksheets are busy work and completely outdated. Teachers do not use the Wilson/Fundations appropriately at the young level and students are missing HUGE phonemic awareness skills.  Many teachers just send MORE worksheets to challenge students and don't think outside of the box when challenging gifted and talented children.  With respect to the lower students,  students are pushed on to the next topic and are not given enough time to master concepts and skills are not well developed.  I was told one year that ""we have to move on even if he doesn't know it"". ","Within the lower grades, students are sent out of the classroom and are missing content learning.

Bringing back something like the Inner Challenge program that addresses self-awareness, and organizational and time management skills would be of great benefit to SJGS students.",
,,,,,,,"I think it would be helpful to have a bit more of an overview session -- maybe like all the primary grades together etc etc, and then grade level meetings in the classroom. The teachers work together so much (at least our experience in the early grades) that it's helpful to have them work together to talk about their goals and expectations. Perhaps this is specific to this year, in which there was a new teacher in each grade level for my children, but I'd like a bit more overarching guidance and then specific questions with each teacher.",,We particularly like family groups and the other ways that the school builds a kind and caring culture in which children look out for one another and feel part of a strong community.,"We generally have not had issues with this, but I do hear from my children about ""a bad kid"" or who gets the most ""stop & reflects,"" and I hope that discipline is largely handled in a positive, formative way, rather than punitive. I think that isolating students or punishing them with loss of recess, not being able to socialize at lunch, etc is not only ineffective, but counter-productive. The research largely shows this to be true, and I hope that the school staff will engage in conversations about how to build trust, confidence, and the ability to make good choices in all students, rather than singling students out through disciplinary procedures.",,,,,,,,,The use of FACTS for the vast majority of payments and fees is so very helpful!,"(1) Strong, caring community, (2) rigorous academics, and (3) responsive, engaged leadership","(1) Lunchtime -- it currently feels very restrictive and unpleasant (though it has improved over the course of this school year), and I really feel like lunch should be an enjoyable, social time for the kids. I recognize that they need to eat, and that sometimes they get a little rowdy, but the responses of making them eat in silence and threatening loss of recess seem overly harsh and make the whole time seem rather punitive. This is particularly the case in the 3rd-5th grade lunch period. 
(2) Class size -- while class sizes in the early grades improved a bit this year, they still seem large relative to what we know from research works best. Especially in K, they seem like they are bursting at the seams of those classrooms. I know it is hard with such high demand for the school, particularly in the early grades, but I encourage the administration to keep exerting some downward pressure on early grades class sizes to ensure the high quality for which the school is known.","Thanks! I appreciate the opportunity to offer thoughts, and we are generally very happy with all that the school leadership and staff do for our children."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Committed parents and parish; Holy Cross priests; generally strong students,The Math education is below the level of public schools.  The language education is limited and weak.  Students entering high school -- even the most academically capable students -- are therefore at a disadvantage.,"It appeared that this year there was a decision to ""teach to the ISTEP"" and really celebrate passing that test.  I'm not sure why that happened.  In the past my impression was that the ISTEP was a necessary evil that the teachers did not focus on.  And there was a consistently high pass rate.  Teaching to the test seems to be a regression in standards."

The second grade curriculum is appropriately challenging.  My sense of the kindergarten curriculum is that it could be more challenging.,,,,,,"The timing of the conference strikes me as a bit too early in the year to give meaningful feedback on a child's progress.

I find it to be a very challenging curriculum but I am worried that it can be too challenging in some aspects and in other areas ( Spanish in a particular - very poor),I love the resource teachers in general and my children do depend on them... the overall resources in the classroom seem to be ok but in no way cutting edge.,,"Overall I feel like there are strong teachers but my concern is that in some of the recent hires, they were brought in and not the best candidates.  In addition, I would like to know if Mr. Azar has had sufficient enough time to evaluate some existing teachers to see if they are and continue to be the strongest people for the job.  ",I have had for the first time a feeling like we don't have a strong teacher overall in Mrs. Mammon.  I was worried from day one during parent orientation night when she seemed overwhelmed in even speaking to us and did not seem confident in her new role to teach a higher level.  Parent teacher conferences were not much better.... I have enrolled my daughter in Sylvan to just make sure she would be able to keep up if not get a head in math because I was not confident in her skills to teach the subject.  It was explained to me that Mrs. Young is assisting Mrs. Mammon in teaching math?  Why?  If she is there to assist each student and help one on one but I am not understanding this if she is needed and Mrs. Mammon lacks experience at this grade level.  If this is not the case then I have been mis informed.  ,"Report cards are very clear.... I would say Parent conferences are helpful if the teacher knows what they are reviewing ( Mrs. Mammon openly said "" I don't understand these results because they are new to me"")   ",see above... I do like the older children being involved in their conferences and was very impressed by this.  I thought it was very good and helpful.,"I think these are good overall.... we also might be benefited from once or twice a year a ""Town Meeting"" of sorts if the principle was willing to give a update on the school year ahead/ or during.  Just an idea.  I haven't been able to attend the once yet during the day but loved the idea of the opportunity to have George Present if there to ask questions.",I feel as though this has been the best programs and very age appropriate information we have received throughout our time here.  I think it is a blessing for our children to have this religion program.  I know it gets harder for Mrs. Gelchion as the kids get into the teen years but I think it is great.  I am not looking forward to what they are doing in the HS program honestly and may very well looks elsewhere than ST JOE HS partly due the the horrible things I have heard about Religion at ST JOE HS.... but I know that my children are getting a very solid base here,,I think the new administration seems to empower teachers more to do what they need to for this area and also seems to be giving the staff that ability to manage the problems effectively rather than it always seeming to need to go through the admin.  ,,Excellent and SJGS always seems to appreciate the efforts of parents as well.,,,,"Overall, I think the teachers do an amazing job at keeping information going out to parents.  Mrs. Schroeder this year has been awesome in her willingness to do everything to get info out to us and even to do the intstagram etc... I don't always have the time to read everything but amazing at how much they do share especially in the younger grades .",,,,"Academic reputation, Catholic Identity, School Community","Improvements in excurricular activities is improving with the new gym, The ratio is tough but manageable as long as the teachers can work within their spaces. ","I think the survey was great to have.  I feel like the new administration should be commended for the fact that I really feel like the school not only has a strong leader who is confident in himself  but for the first time I feel like the teachers are happy to be growing as leaders themselves.  They seem happier, more empowered  and willing to take independent roles in leading their classrooms.  I just feel like the previous admin had been so used to overseeing every aspect of the School, it dominated the growth of the staff.  

In the future, I would like to know if the current admin is taking a hard look at teacher development and evaluation process.  I would like to know if everyone ( old and new teachers) are under going strong evaluations regarding the standards that are expected by parents who have chosen to send their kids to SJGS.  I also hope that there is a opportunity to help teachers who might be good but have had no guidance regarding how they might change their programs ...I wondered if at some point how maybe a veteran teacher might be brought in to help our teachers become better teachers.  Maybe the new VP may be the person to do such a role but that sees to me to be the key to continuing our growth.  I have been surprised to hear from parents of former students to hear that they at times were not impressed with the teaching pool.... despite their overall pleasure with all aspects of the school.   This last year with so many families leaving the 6 th grade it made me question some of those thoughts.

Lastly, I just want to say that I feel strongly that there needs to be a change in the Spanish or language program we have at SJGS.  It has not been a priority for our family but I also feel like it is basically a waste of time that could be used for even kids learning more practical programs in either computers or learning to ""take notes"" or other practical test taking methodology.  I would love to keep language in the program but not the way it is right now.  These children are the perfect age and they seem to be learning nothing  now. 

I have several children using Resource teachers and my only other concern is that I don't understand why a child who is in the resource program the year before , comes back to school and is put on hold to receive resources for almost two months because the resource teacher has to do ""evaluations"" of the other students all over again.  That makes no sense to me.... a child who gets services at the end of a school year should go right back into services and then if seemingly doesn't need them anymore should be phased out.  The first two weeks of school teachers should be working to see what other students needs are but a ""evaluation"" of students who didn't need services the previous year seems silly.  I will be asking Mr. Azar about this in the coming weeks   

I would like to say that I think a great improvement has been in the arts, music and gym.  Mrs. Sweazy is a gift in particular and I hope we can do everything in our power to keep her for as long a possible.   She had transformed our Arts experience.   I also hope that we continue to develop music as I think Mrs. Hill is and work to improve the gym and physical fitness programs. 

 I would like to see if the school were to ever consider that the little kids could go to a "" sweatsuit"" day for the day they have Gym.  I realize that the big kids need to change after sweating in Gym but if the school went to a Warm up for the younger kids, a universal color and logo, it can be handed down from child to child and I think would allow the little ones to move better and engage more in their gym day.  Shorts, tee shirts can be worn on gym days and they stay in the tee but wear their uniform shorts over for the rest of their day.  Just an idea.  These sweatsuits can also double as team warm up for sporting teams.   Catholic schools in Chicago do it and it seems to be a good alternative also to dress down days in the older grades.
